# Black-Scholes Options Pricing Model
Input a stock ticker and additional financial data in order to yield the price of a call/put option using the Black-Scholes Options Pricing Model. It uses data from Yahoo Finance to fetch stock data and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to fetch risk-free treasury rates. Based on the inputs, the model uses the built-in equation to calculate the price of the option.
