# Black-Scholes Options Pricing Model
Input a stock ticker and additional financial data in order to yield the price of a call/put option using the Black-Scholes Options Pricing Model. It uses data from Yahoo Finance to fetch stock data and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to fetch risk-free treasury rates. Based on the inputs, the model uses the Black-Scholes equation to calculate the price of the option.
## Files
The Python file uses Streamlit to create an interactive web application that will take in the user inputs and provide the price of the derivative. On the other hand, the Jupyter Notebook lets the user run the code in their terminal.
